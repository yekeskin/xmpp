We are open to contributions for ejabberd, as GitHub pull requests (PR).
Here are a few points to consider before submitting your PR. (You can
remove the whole text after reading.)

1. Does this PR address an issue? Please reference it in the PR
   description.

2. Have you properly described the proposed change?

3. Please make sure the change is atomic and only touches the needed
   files. If you have other changes/fixes to provide, please submit
   them as separate PRs, or in separate commits.

4. Don't mix in the same commit your improvements in the source code
   and the changes produced when running `make spec` or `make xdata`.
   In fact, don't commit changes generated automatically, because
   there's a GitHub Action that will do this once your PR is merged.

5. Do you provide tests? How can we check the behavior of the code?

6. Are there any changes required in the documentation?
